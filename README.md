# ⚠ WOAH HOLD ON THERE! ⚠
If you're seeing this, I'm not quite ready to turn everything in! I'm going to delete this when the project's done! I still have some comments, reorganization, and other suchlike to do.

## Python Fullstack Example: PIXEL INSPIRATION
As a hobbyist amateur pixel art artist and animator, I find myself in need of inspiration for composition, texture, and even color palette. This app is designed to accept simple image-generator prompts and then produce sequences of useful displays of silhouetting, texture, and color palettes, as well as provide permalinks for future reference for those!

## Requirements

Want to run this? Here's some things you'll need.
- An installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Multiple GB of free space for the associated models (keep space free for several dozen GB, to be safe).
- No apps currently using port 5000.

## Recommendations
It's nice to have these.
- One or more graphics cards with CUDA compatibility.
- CUDA drivers.
- A [MySQL DB](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) installed.

## Setup Process
