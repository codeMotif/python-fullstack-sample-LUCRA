# Python Fullstack Example: PIXEL INSPIRATION
As a hobbyist amateur pixel art artist and animator, I find myself in need of inspiration for composition, texture, and even color palette. This app is designed to accept simple image-generator prompts and then produce sequences of useful displays of silhouetting, texture, and color palettes, as well as provide permalinks for future reference for those!

# Requirements

Want to run this? Here's some things you'll need.
- An installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Multiple GB of free space for the associated models (keep space free for several dozen GB, to be safe).
- No apps currently using port 5000.

# Recommendations
It's nice to have these.
- One or more graphics cards with CUDA compatibility.
- CUDA drivers.

# Setup Process
